# ''_Sleep Project_''

## WRITE-UP

Today's project went pretty well considering my mental fatigue due to a dry cough I am currently experiencing. I started it last night to save myself some time and I liked that, I think I will continue to break projects into chunks from now on. I will still try to do them in one day but giving myself a break every now and then helps a lot with coder happiness and mental fatigue. 

## NITTY-GRITTY

Elements of this project didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped. I had, initially, spawned the idea of using pseudo elements to take care of the decorative lines on either side of the div dividing images (such as the tiny sheep just before the footer) but that didn't work out. I still don't know why and I don't know if I can go back in to find out but it was probably just a css attribute dedicated to something else but also, unintentionally and unexpectedly, covered the element I was trying to style with pseudos. After that, my mind felt a bit low on gas so my dedication to efficiency and extreme perfection faultered a bit. I attribute this to the fact that I know I am not working for a client so it doesn't really matter. However, in the future I will do my best to combat this negative mental acceleration and it's effects of defocusing or lessening my degree of meticulousness.

Other than that stuff, this project was pretty easy and I am glad to have it behind me. I loved the practice. Looking forward to my next project. Peace out!
